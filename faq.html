		<H3>What is PubCloud?</H3>
		<P>PubCloud is a member of the <A
			HREF="http://bioinfo.icapture.ubc.ca:8090/IF/cloud/" TARGET="_blank">CloudBrowse</A>
		family, created by members of the <A
			HREF="http://bioinfo.icapture.ubc.ca" TARGET="_blank">Wilkinson
		Laboratory</A> at the <A HREF="http://www.icapture.ubc.ca/home.shtml"
			TARGET="_blank">James Hogg iCAPTURE Centre for Cardiovascular and
		Pulmonary Research</A> at the <A
			HREF="http://www.providencehealthcare.org/" TARGET="_blank">St.
		Paul's Hospital</A> in Vancouver, British Columbia.</P>
		<P>The creation of PubCloud was inspired by the recently broad
		adaptation of <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud"
			TARGET="_blank">tag clouds</A> on the Internet. PubCloud uses tag
		cloud as a means of summarizing large amount of abstract texts
		returned by the search in <A HREF="http://www.pubmed.com"
			TARGET="_blank">PubMed</A>, a centralized repository that indexes
		millions of biomedical applications.</P>
		<BR>

		<H3>What is a tag cloud?</H3>
		<P>A tag cloud is a visually-weighted rendition of collections of
		words (tags) that can be used to represent the concepts present in
		large collections of information. The qualities of associations
		between each tag and the entity it describes, such as frequency or
		recency, are visually represented with variable font sizes and colours
		(e.g. more frequently used tags might be larger or brighter than less
		frequently used tags).</P>
		<P>In a typical implementation of a tag cloud (i.e. <A
			HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/" TARGET="_blank">Flickr</A>),
		font sizes are used to represent the frequency of occurrences of the
		particular tag, the larger the tag, the more frequent it appears. In
		addition, some implementations (i.e. <A
			HREF="http://www.connotea.org/cloud" TARGET="_blank">Connotea</A>)
		use colours to represent how recent the tag was created, the brighter
		(i.e. reddish) the more recent. Some other implementations also add
		proximity, underline...etc for more measures.</P>

		<BR>

		<H3>How is PubCloud different from PubMed?</H3>
		<P>PubMed is a repository for biomedical literatures, in the
		original text format, with the addition of some structural
		information, such as authors, publication date, keywords, MeSH
		terms...etc. PubCloud, on the other hand, is a tool for summarizing
		information returned by the the PubMed search engine. It summarizes 3
		types of data, abstract text, authors, and MeSH terms, in a tag cloud
		format, with frequency and recency information represented in font
		sizes and font colours, respectively.</P>
		<BR>

		<H3>Is PubCloud designed to replace PubMed?</H3>
		<P>Absolutely not! PubCloud is a way of summarizing and
		visualizing PubMed search results. PubCloud provides a way for quickly
		browsing and navigating through the tag cloud interface. By clicking
		on each tag you add to the list of search terms and PubCloud generates
		a new tag cloud using this list of terms to search PubMed. Until you
		are satisfied, you can then click into view the PubMed abstracts that
		were used to build the tag cloud.</P>
		<BR>

		<H3></H3>
		<P></P>

		<H3>Has PubCloud been published?</H3>
		<P>Yes, PubCloud was published as a poster abstract at the WWW
		2007 Conference in Banff, Canada. The publication is available online.

		<BR>

		<H3>Will PubCloud be continuously improved?</H3>
		<P>Yes, PubCloud is continuously undergoing improvements. New
		features will be updated as soon as they are available.</P>
		<BR>

		<H3>Is PubCloud a web service?</H3>
		<P>No, not yet. It will be made a web service in the near future.
		</P>

		<H3>Who do I contact if I have questions?</H3>
		<P>If you have any question, or if you have encountered, please
		send an email to <A HREF="mailto:bkuo@mrl.ubc.ca">Byron Kuo</A>
		describing in detail your questions or the bug.</P>
